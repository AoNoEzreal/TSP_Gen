# TSP_Gen
Trying to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with python and genetic algorithm

The file "ProjetThreads.py" contains the classic iterative solution, i first register all the points from a csv file, i then compute a distance matrix and then compute each path's distance by reading from the matrix. 

The second one is the genetic algorithm solution
