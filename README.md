# TSP_Gen
## Intro
Trying to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem with python and genetic algorithm

The file "ProjetThreads.py" contains the classic iterative solution, i first register all the points from a csv file, i then compute a distance matrix and then compute each path's distance by reading from the matrix. 

The second one is the genetic algorithm solution, for now i stuck with basic shuffling gene mutation. If i ever get the time and motivation i'll try to implement pooling selection to refine my results. 

All of the data comes from [University of Waterloo's website](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html)

## Usage 
Clone the repository and run
`python ProjetAlgoGenetique.py`
